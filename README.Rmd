## Lochranza Ecological Impact Assessment

R Project for an Ecological Impact Assessment that took place on the Isle of Arran
Data collection occurred in September 2025 and all subsequent analyses occurred in the latter part of 2025.

The project focused on the idea of two sites that were proposed as locations for a Carbon Credit program.
The two sites are the North and South slopes, these lie to the north and south of the Lochranza Field Centre
To Assess which site was better suited to becoming a carbon credit, data was collected from each site. Data collection consisted of:
* Desk-based assessment of the site and local area
* Phase 1 habitat survey
* Baseline ecological surveys of the two sites
